    <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
    <p>Last updated: October 27, 2025</p>

    <p>
      Welcome to the <strong>Jira Visualization App</strong> (“the App”). 
      By accessing or using this App, you agree to these Terms of Use (“Terms”). 
      Please read them carefully before using the App.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Purpose of the App</h2>
    <p>
      The App is designed to securely connect with Atlassian Jira and visualize project-related data 
      for internal company use. It provides dashboards, charts, and analytics to support project tracking, 
      reporting, and team management.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>
      By using the App, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by these Terms. 
      If you do not agree, you should not use the App.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Authorized Use</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The App may only be used for authorized company or personal projects.</li>
      <li>You must not use the App to access or display Jira data belonging to third parties without permission.</li>
      <li>You agree not to misuse the App or interfere with its normal operation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Access and Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The App uses Atlassian’s official OAuth 2.0 authorization to access Jira data. 
      Only the data required for visualization (e.g., project names, issue details, and user assignments) 
      is retrieved, and no sensitive information is permanently stored.
      Please review our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for full details.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>
      All content, design elements, and source code of the App are the intellectual property of the developer 
      or their organization. You may not copy, modify, or distribute the App without prior written consent.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>
      The App is provided “as is” and “as available.” We do not guarantee that the App will always function 
      without errors, interruptions, or security issues. The App is intended for internal visualization purposes only.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      In no event shall the developer, company, or any associated party be held liable for any indirect, incidental, 
      or consequential damages resulting from the use or inability to use the App.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>
      We may update these Terms periodically. Any changes will be reflected by updating the “Last updated” date above. 
      Continued use of the App after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.
    </p>
