    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: October 27, 2025</p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information when you use our 
      <strong>Jira Visualization App</strong> (the "App"). This App is used internally within our company 
      to visualize and analyze project data from Jira for reporting and management purposes.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      The App accesses limited project-related data from your Atlassian Jira account, including issue summaries, 
      project details, user assignments, and workflow statuses. This information is retrieved solely for the purpose 
      of creating visual dashboards and insights for company projects.
    </p>

    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To generate real-time visual reports and dashboards from Jira data.</li>
      <li>To support project tracking, productivity analysis, and resource planning.</li>
      <li>To maintain and improve the performance and functionality of the App.</li>
      <li>To provide technical support if required.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>
      The App does not permanently store or share sensitive user data. All Jira data retrieved through 
      the Atlassian API is processed in real-time and deleted after visualization or upon session termination. 
      Access tokens are securely managed according to OAuth 2.0 best practices.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      The App uses Atlassianâ€™s official OAuth 2.0 API for secure authorization and data access. 
      No information is shared with any third-party service other than Atlassian.
    </p>

    <h2>Your Consent</h2>
    <p>
      By using this App, you consent to the limited collection and use of Jira data as described in this Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>
      If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or how your data is handled, 
      please contact us at:
